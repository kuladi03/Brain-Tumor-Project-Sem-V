## About
This project aims to develop a brain tumor detection system using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes medical data to classify whether a patient has a brain tumor or not. The project utilizes various classifiers and techniques to achieve high accuracy in tumor detection.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python (>=3.6)
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
   cd brain-tumor-detection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install project dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Modify the dataset or provide your own data in the required format.
- Train different machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
- Use the trained models for brain tumor detection on new data.

## Dataset
The project uses a synthetic brain tumor dataset. You can replace it with your own dataset or use real-world medical data.

## Models
The project employs various machine learning classifiers, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and others. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning are included to improve accuracy.

## Results
The project reports the accuracy of different models and provides insights into their performance.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute to the project.
